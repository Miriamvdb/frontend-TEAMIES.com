# TEAMIES

Teamies is a page for sport teams, where a user can specify their participation for trainings, matches and custamizable events. The trainer has a good overview now of the players availability. In this case I made an example with my own soccerteam.

## Technology I used

Frontend: React / Redux / Axios
Backend: Sequelize / PostgreSQL / Express
